# Animal-Crossing-design

Designs made with these templates and palette are intended for use with
[Animal Xing Designer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nefastudio.android.dmoridesigner)
(Android app).

They may also be used with other applications, such as
[QR MyDesign Assistant](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qr-mydesign-assistant-for/id588617754?mt=8)
(iOS), and other similar applications â€” although I'm not sure if the
template is correct.


## Installation

Please copy the `gpl` file in `palette` into the `palettes` folder of
your local Gimp configuration. 

On Linux, this will probably be in a directory like
`~/.gimp-2.8/palettes/`


## Usage

1. Open template
2. Design!
3. Convert to indexed in Gimp, using the Gimp palette
4. Simply import as image in your design appliaction
5. Export as QR
6. Import QR using your 3DS in your town's Able Sister's QR machine
7. Wear your new design!

If you make something you really like, don't forget to share it!
(You can do so in-store or by posting QR codes to imgur.com.)


## Tips

* Be sure to think about where sleeves meet the body of shirts, and the
  fact that the shirt will wrap around the body.
* Sleeves wrap around. The sleeves themselves are both the top and
  bottom halves, so a little will peek out when your character is
  running.
